        <h1>10 - 2 hour</h1>
        <p>
            These runs are the begginer runs, meant to get you started. 
            10 and 5 hour don't even have skips, and put you at relatively high power.
            These wont get you high places on the leaderboard, but they will get you semi familiar with the route.
            <br>
            If you are completely knew to speedrunning, begin with the 10 hour guide.
            <br>
            If you have beaten the game multiple times, begin with the 5 hour guide.
            <br>
            If you want to begin getting close to the main speedrun route, begin with the 2 hour guide.
